I am a second year MS student in Robotics in University of Pennsylvania. Currently, I am advised by Prof. Kostas Danillidis. I spent one year as a research assistant in Southern University of Science and Technology, advised by Prof. [Jiankun Wang](https://jkwang1992.github.io/). Before that, I got my bachelor's degree at Xi'an Jiaotong University, majored in automation. I also did internship in [Megvii Research Institute](https://www.megvii.com/). 

I am interested in the uncertainty quantification and active learning, and how could this enable robot to operate in real world.

I use RPFey, which is the abbreviation of **R**ichard **P**. **Fey**nman, for my github user name. I admire him because he has the magic to simplify things. I loved to read Feynman's Lecture in Physics during high school and undergrads. Some video interviews, for example, the one about human understanding, also impressed me.
