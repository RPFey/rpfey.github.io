Boshu Lei
======
I am a second year MS student in Robotics in University of Pennsylvania. Currently, I am advised by Prof. Kostas Danillidis. Before that, I got my bachelor's degree at Xi'an Jiaotong University, majored in automation. Previously, I also did internship in [Megvii Research Institute](https://www.megvii.com/). 

I am interested in the uncertainty quantification and active learning, and how could this enable robot to operate in real world.
