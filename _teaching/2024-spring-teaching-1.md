I was the TA for CIS 580 machine perception during the Spring in 2024. Here is one problem I designed for the geometry in computer vision which I found very interesting.

Suppose, you mount a camera on a vehicle and this vehicle is driving on the road. You can detect both sides of the lane, which are two parallel lines in the world. You know the width of the lane. You can measure any quantaty in the image. Now you can only use geometric methods to compute the distance from the vehicle to one side of the road (localize the vehicle on the road). Here we assume the optical axis is parallel to the ground and there is only rotation over the y-axis (down) of the camera.
